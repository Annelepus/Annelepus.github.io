                                A member of Operations Team Z7 in Endfield, Fluorite is responsible for scouting and
                                disrupting enemy lines. Her command of street rules and dirty tricks rivals her
                                sharpshooting, sparing the team from countless troubles. Hailing from the frontier at
                                the edge of the Civilization Band, she sharpened her eye through constant migrations and
                                wandering. More often than not, she simply sits in the corner with a faint smile,
                                leaving others with the unsettling sense that every flaw has already been laid bare
                                under her gaze.<br>
                                But don't mistake her for empathetic. Fluorite's knack for reading people gives her
                                exceptional instincts on the battlefield, but also leaves her dangerously good at
                                stirring people up with just a few words — making her the team's most unpredictable
                                source of trouble.<br>
                                "Got anything to say? No? How about we just call it a day?"<br>

                            Operator Fluorite once encouraged local civilians to violently resist a criminal
                            organization and helped an Endfield field operations team escape certain threats. Operator
                            Akekuri thus endorsed Fluorite's employment with Endfield Industries. She is now a member of
                            Operations Team Z7. No new criminal records have been filed against the Operator since
                            then.<br>
                            <br>
                            Pay particular attention to Fluorite in social settings. Her "personal grudges" are usually
                            not as significant as we make them, but conversations with her may take unexpected turns.
                            Fortunately, Fluorite is not adverse to being a listener. Since we place greater importance
                            on an operator's combat capabilities, her peculiarity is not particularly difficult to
                            handle.<br>
                            However, she seized the initiative and answered every question on the list before I formally
                            delivered it to her. In fact, she even started laughing before I could complete my engaging
                            answers. This situation was not predicted by my algorithms. Hence, this interview has been
                            added to the archives of unique case studies for further analysis.<br>

                            According to Fluorite herself, her Originium Arts solely focused on the creation of
                            polymorphic fluids with adhesive abilities. However, if this were true (which I personally
                            feel to be not), then her malignant social skills could only be explained by her "extensive
                            experiences" — since she has expert-level abilities in identifying damaging information
                            about others. Fluorite's willingness to reveal such information without hesitation is
                            another thing entirely. Even though Arts assimilation test results are publicly accessible,
                            there are those who stubbornly believe that Fluorite has secret "divination" abilities.<br>
                            "Just think about it. You almost flopped your PE and the instructor just gave you an earful.
                            While heading back to the dorms you see Fluorite along the corridors and she suddenly goes,
                            'I guess it can't be helped. Midnight sandwiches are just so divine'... She's so friggin'
                            annoying! Fine, I know I shouldn't be snacking at night but why would she say it out
                            loud?"<br>
                            One Operations Team Z7 member once voiced their frustrations, but instead of receiving
                            comfort, they were met with a chorus of knowing looks that silently said, "I feel you." In
                            all fairness, Fluorite does not intend to stir up trouble and she hardly speaks during
                            dialogs. However, her carefree nature combined with her excessively unforgiving tone proved
                            to be rather discomforting to most people during many situations. When these issues were
                            brought before Fluorite, her defense was simple and sincere:<br>
                            "You want me to go and apologize?"

                            (Handwritten scribbles) That "certain" spokesperson is Powell. He deserved it.<br>
                            <br>
                            SOW Notes: After much persuasion from our side, Operator Fluorite voluntarily submitted this
                            bounty poster. As of now, we can verify that no copies furnished with her handwriting can be
                            found. The Human Resources Division has already conferred with Operator Fluorite regarding
                            the public attack on the spokesperson. Please direct your inquiries to the said division if
                            you need to peruse the relevant records.<br>
                            Spokesperson Powell did not suffer serious physical injuries, but his public image took a
                            significant blow. This was due not only to his exaggerated and undignified reactions to the
                            intense pain, but also to the revelation that Fluorite's malicious demeanor after the
                            incident sharply contrasted with the public persona she had cultivated. Our investigations
                            further revealed that Spokesperson Powell's early political activities were primarily
                            centered around several free cities near the frontiers. Records indicate frequent
                            interactions with leaders of various minor criminal organizations. One such example is
                            "Weird Neck" Logan, who once dominated the town of Oriron Screw and is a potential suspect
                            in illicit crop trading and the use of forced labor in hazardous environments. Logan has, on
                            multiple occasions, granted Powell monetary benefits in exchange for protection.<br>
                            <br>
                            Operator Fluorite's final action in the town of Oriron Screw obviously revealed her personal
                            grudge against Spokesperson Powell, who had secretly offered protection for local criminal
                            organizations. After accessing monitoring records, we verified that Fluorite carried out the
                            deed while donning a mask. Spokesperson Powell's criminal records have since been submitted
                            to the TGCC. This incident is unlikely to trigger further PR issues, for now.<br>

                            "The thing is, those towns and villages have been completely abandoned. According to the
                            path described by Fluorite herself, you'll realize that she's like a scavenger, swooping
                            from one dying town to the next. Once a new 'corpse' appears, she would spread her wings and
                            'fly off' again..."<br>
                            "I'm not questioning her motives. These vagabonds were not the ones who caused the towns to
                            fade away. Folks could only find less than ideal places to settle, places that only had
                            limited access to support and resources from the fringes. If a hub city meets a crisis, then
                            the resulting supply breakdown could initiate a chain reaction capable of killing every town
                            along the route."<br>
                            "Death starts from the most isolated spots, the weakest link of the chain. Refugees would
                            then ride the wave of collapse until they either arrive at a new town that offers enough
                            stability, or fade away completely in the wildlands like a certain town out there... People
                            even came up with a special name to describe this phenomenon."<br>
                            "As long as the links between our cities remain fragile and tenuous, the stranding will
                            never end. Crisis breeds privilege, and privilege is a hot bed for sin. Once we reach the
                            threshold, Civilization is no longer a home, but a yoke that the monopolists shackle onto
                            the necks of their slaves."<br>
                            "We must master the power that can help us prevent this from happening."<br>
