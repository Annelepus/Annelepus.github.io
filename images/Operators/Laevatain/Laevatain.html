                                Laevatain is a Rhodes island operator who joined Endfield at the Endministrator's direct
                                recommendation. Under the framework
                                <br>
                                agreement between the two companies, she serves as an operator directly under the
                                Endiminstrator's command.
                                <br>
                                Before joining Endfield Industries, Laevatain raomed the world alone, pursuing a goal
                                she could call her own. Because of that
                                <br>
                                journey, and her formidable skill in solo combat, people often mistake her for "someone
                                you can't talk to." In truth, the opposite is
                                <br>
                                closer to reality. It's only that her earnest, fortright nature sometimes comes across
                                too strongly, giving rise to misunderstanding.
                                <br>
                                At times, though, she speaks in ways that confound others, often circling back to the
                                subject of "memory", as if she were purposefully
                                <br>
                                trying to separate herself from who she is.
                                She often wields flames, yet craves ice cream just as much. To her, maybe that
                                contradiction
                                feels perfectly natural. <br>"Try getting closer to me if you're still feeling cold."

                            Reconvener and Operator Laevatain joined Endfield with the Endministrator's direct
                            recommendation. After acquiring her personal agreement, as well as approval from the HR
                            Division and authentication from Rhodes Island, Laevatain joined Endfield as an operator
                            under the direct command of the Endministrator.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Laevatain arrived at the reception area a full 45 minutes ahead of the agreed-upon schedule.
                            She simply placed the employment notification on the table and said little else except, "I'm
                            here. We can begin."
                            She was quite cooperative during the initial phase of the interview — giving her signature,
                            submitting a retinal scan, and linking her Protocol Authority Level without a single fuss or
                            comment. I tried to liven up the atmosphere by saying, "Welcome to Endfield." She nodded and
                            replied, "I'm already here."
                            During job-inclination testing, I followed the prescribed list of questions and asked if she
                            considered utilizing her skill set in other non-combat roles, such as combat planner, coach,
                            or instructor. She did not say anything but appeared obviously annoyed.
                            In the end, Operator Laevatain left with this final line: "Just let me go to as many places
                            you can — places that let me build as much memories as I can."

                            Endministrator and Supervisor Perlica of Endfield Industries:<br>
                            I am extremely pleased to learn that Laevatain has returned with the Endministrator's help.
                            Though her journey is far from complete, her return proves that she has found a new
                            objective and people whom she is willing to travel with.<br>
                            Extremely powerful "desire and hope" drove Laevatain to step onto the lands of Talos-II.
                            When we first sensed her existence, the light she gave off was bedazzling. I later realized
                            that this light was emitted by her obsession — her innermost ego demanding the answer: "Who
                            am I?"<br>
                            Led on by the said obsession, the fragments awakened and created a complete persona. "She"
                            walked out of the Originium Woods, new and intact, and arrived at Rhodes Island bearing the
                            name "Laevatain". I thought she would immediately become one of our strongest assets and
                            supporters, but she turned us down. Just like Surtr who had always walked alone, no one can
                            command Laevatain or force her to stay in one place. She will answer to no faction until she
                            finds the answer to dispel her own miasma of amnesia. Hence, we decided to open the doors
                            and give her our best farewells.<br>
                            Once, I was worried that Laevatain's choice would affect other reconveners. Then I realized
                            that they became reconveners because every one of them did not forget the old dream and
                            vision. And that is why they reconvened with you on this very same path. Now, this thought
                            alone has lifted a stone off my chest.<br>
                            Since Laevatain is currently an official Endfielder fighting along your side, then allow me
                            to share a few words of advice (based on my knowledge of "her") for "getting along with
                            her".<br>
                            Firstly, accommodate and accept Laevatain's straightforward nature. She often says whatever
                            that comes to her mind. It is not an act of hostility, malice, or rudeness. In fact, such
                            words are a symbol of her sincere and undisguised attitude — "I prefer to simply tell you
                            what I'm thinking right now."<br>
                            Secondly, should Laevatain exhibit obvious signs of fury or impatience, do not attempt to
                            persuade her to "calm" down. Believe me, there are more effective means, such as the
                            provision of ice cream or other things that can rapidly "cool" the situation. Laevatain is
                            someone you can communicate with, but she dislikes "being told what to do".<br>
                            Just as a side note, before she left Rhodes Island, she took all the crimsonberry ice cream
                            from my lab freezer — and ate them all, right before my eyes, as though it was the right
                            thing to do. "Thought you told me memories can lie," she said as she licked the spoon, "So I
                            better have more of this to make it as memorable as possible." Laevatain marked her farewell
                            with this action to ensure the veracity of the moment. She actually cares very deeply about
                            her friends, far more deeply than most would like to think.<br>
                            Thirdly, Laevatain is extremely similar to Surtr, but according to her temperament... Do not
                            tell her that she resembles Surtr. Also, do not tell her that she DOES NOT resemble Surtr.
                            In fact, do not ever compare her to Surtr, unless she brings the topic up herself. Always
                            remember this!<br>
                            Best wishes in your collective journey across Talos-II.

                            AUTHOR: Dulla Gray, clinical psychologist<br>
                            <br>
                            LOG 1<br>
                            Surgeon Answorth has been dispatched to the surface in response to an emergency. So, this is
                            my first time providing psychotherapeutic services on my own ever since I joined Endfield.
                            The details of the job is to provide psychological evaluations for an onboarding operator. I
                            hope this is the start of a beautiful relationship between us.<br>
                            ............<br>
                            I've waited for six hours but the operator did not show up.<br>
                            <br>
                            LOG 2<br>
                            I verified the records. Turns out the operator is a reconvener troubled by "polymnestic
                            disorders". I remain the chief therapist in charge of this case.<br>
                            My second meeting (which is technically the first, all facts considered) with Operator
                            Laevatain was successful. I did the psychological evaluations that we missed last time, and
                            she also explained why she failed to show up for that meeting. It appeared that she was
                            deeply troubled and annoyed by certain nightmares. Hence, she chose to head to the surface
                            and "sort the feelings out". With my encouragement, she agreed to describe her dreams to
                            me.<br>
                            <br>
                            Laevatain dreamed of herself standing in a classroom. One by one her classmates introduced
                            themselves on the stage. But when it was her turn, she tried to open her mouth but no voice
                            came out. She tried again, but her throat began to hurt and she only managed to emit
                            blurred, raspy noises.<br>
                            The teacher turned around, but a raging flame danced where her face should be, "You could
                            not say it because you never had your own life."<br>
                            Laevatain tried to leave the classroom, only to find herself in a familiar yet alien-looking
                            house. Everything around her was burning. The fire consumed the walls, the books, and the
                            mirrors. Her classmates, friends, teachers, families, and even colleagues she met in Rhodes
                            Island and Dijiang stood in the room, but all their faces were contortions of twisted flame
                            and no longer recognizable.<br>
                            She then ran for the door and forced her way through, only to find herself in the exact same
                            house, also on fire. She ran again, opened the door, and saw the same thing.
                            With every door she went through, the room got smaller and the flames got closer.
                            In the end, she opened the final door and arrived at a room of ashes with neither fire nor
                            smoke. She saw herself seated in the room, smiling at her:<br>
                            "You finally burnt everything."<br>
                            <br>
                            Laevatain's recurring dream appears to be rooted in "memories" she has carried in her mind.
                            Whether these are drawn from real experiences or mere illusions is unclear, but it seems she
                            has been journeying with this burden for a long time.<br>
                            <br>
                            LOG 3<br>
                            I tried prescribing several recommended therapies for Operator Laevatain but the results
                            were less than ideal. After receiving suggestions from Surgeon Answorth, I asked Laevatain
                            if she ever considered medical removal of these memories as the scenes and nightmares
                            continue to affect her in an unabated fashion.<br>
                            She pondered for a moment and denied this advice.
                            Several days later, she described another dream to me.

                            In this dream, Laevatain woke up in a white world. The sky was clean and flawless, and the
                            land seemed endless.<br>
                            She walked for a long time without feeling the wind. She met no one, heard nothing, and saw
                            no shadows.<br>
                            A door stood at the very end. Posted on the door was a note — Enter, if you do not wish to
                            be anyone else.<br>
                            There she stopped. She chose not to open the door.<br>
                            <br>
                            When the session ended, Operator Laevatain gave me a bunch of fiery red flowers — a token of
                            gratitude for "future sessions of memory-sharing".<br>

                            TEST SUMMARY<br>
                            At the 7th second of Phase 1, Operator Laevatain summons a giant flaming blade with one hand
                            (no equipment ID identified; said blade is likely created by Laevatain's Originium Arts) and
                            charges directly into the center of the simulated enemy group before verbal instructions
                            were given nor confirmed.<br>
                            At the 31st second, thermal readings exceeded simulation environment monitoring thresholds.
                            System automatically activates anti-heat measures. Security Professional Krad requests to
                            stop the test but Operator Laevatain denies the request.<br>
                            At the 1-minute and 24-second mark, Operator Laevatain had destroyed all enemy units and
                            assumed a standing pose in the center of the simulation area, while adjusting her breathing
                            after a high-intensity burst of activities.<br>
                            Combat resumed after 38 seconds to initiate Phase 2. Test item "Stationery Suppression" was
                            initiated. The operator's performance was far more extreme than Phase 1 and the entire test
                            was completed after 1 minute and 40 seconds.<br>
                            <br>
                            BEHAVIORAL SUMMARY<br>
                            Combat style is highly aggressive and prioritizes breaking the stalemate with overwhelming
                            force.<br>
                            Prefers seizing combat initiative instead of focusing on tactical coordination. Willingness
                            to support teamwork is unstable.<br>
                            Weapon efficacy is significantly improved at emotional thresholds. Effects include spreading
                            fire, localized scorch marks, and signal interference.<br>
                            <br>
                            TEST REVIEW<br>
                            She is incredibly powerful but has yet to build up the mental fortitude to master it. She
                            does not enjoy destruction, but uses combat as a means to vent her emotions and prove her
                            existence. She must learn how to restrain herself and bring that instability under control —
                            master the fire, but don't become the fire. If she loses her connection to medic or support
                            operators in the team, no one would be able to save her.<br>

                            <br>
                            I don't think you gave me this test to see if I can still fight. You wanted to know if I
                            would "lose control", right? Don't worry ... I know exactly what I'm doing.<br>

                            NOTE: New thermal insulation must be installed in the combat testing area. If there is
                            another test, also prepare 3 servings of Coolant Beverages.<br>

                            DOCUMENT: Post-Operational Summary (ID: SU-58R-TR)<br>
                            During this combat operation, Operator Laevatain charged into the enemy on her own accords
                            at the initial stages of battle, and did not respond to tactical calls from her team. Her
                            actions temporarily severed communications, disrupted the chain of command, and caused
                            momentary panic amongst team members. Fortunately, the team did not suffer any
                            casualties.<br>
                            When the operation ended, analyses of residual energy traces and tactical dataloggers
                            confirmed that Operator Laevatain successfully diverted the focus of enemy fire toward
                            herself with these means: deliberate exposure of her own position and continuous emission of
                            super hot flames that disrupt enemy defenses. In other words, she used herself as a lure to
                            create a tactical breach and allowed our attacking operators to exploit the opening and
                            achieve our tactical objectives.<br>
                            Upon concluding the operation, Operator Laevatain sat on a cooled fragment of molten rock.
                            Burn marks in the vicinity suggested that this area was subjected to extremely intensive
                            strikes. Laevatain said nothing as we surveyed the battlefield. After ascertaining that all
                            other operators were well, she softly said, "Good."<br>

                            Regular Work Report for Operators Under the Endministrator<br>
                            REPORTED BY: Laevatain<br>
                            <br>
                            I escorted the messenger to this volcanic basin. Molten lava flowed through the ground
                            beneath our feet, heating the rain and creek, causing the earth to froth and bubble
                            endlessly. The monitoring station stood right atop this "cauldron of living soup".<br>
                            This place is extremely poor in Originium. Resident scientists rely on geothermal heat to
                            cook food. A ration tin can be cooked through simply by burying it in the dirt for an hour.
                            They even have "pocket stews": a liquid stock and other ingredients sealed in a food-grade
                            bag — after quick cooking, you can just tear it open with your teeth. I got a face full of
                            hot stew once, and it felt like I was on fire.<br>
                            When I had my first meal, the scientist taught me to sing their "ritual" chant: "May your

                            As the Operator closest to the incident and the most capable emergency responder, I was
                            ordered to reach the UWST base not marked on the map with the greatest speed I could muster.
                            The issue was not complicated. Just an unexpected blast furnace malfunction, shutdown, and
                            loss of power. I spent a bit of my powers and helped them re-ignite the core. Temperature
                            returned to operational levels and the system was restored. The crisis was temporarily
                            averted.<br>
                            Their "names" left quite an impression on me. The place was a secret base in the frigid
                            lands of █████, usually referred to by its unique beacon code. Everyone there was forbidden
                            from using their real names or any self-chosen codenames; only the "assigned" name was
                            allowed.<br>
                            My temporary name here was "Olga Randall". I was told there were three others before me with
                            the same name, and it's likely that the next replacement actuary sent here will also take on
                            this name.<br>
                            It was a strange experience. I was just a temporary user of the name "Olga Randall". It felt
                            similar to the memory fragments swimming in my mind. Neither the name nor the fragments were
                            truly mine, but at that very moment, they were all part of me.<br>

                            After eliminating the Aggelos camping in the freight station, I reopened the gate that had
                            kept the tunnel sealed for quite a while.<br>
                            They maintained a low gravity environment within the tunnels. Refugees, trapped here for
                            months, floated their way to the exit, trembling and struggling as they left the place. They
                            must relearn how to walk and run under the ponderous influence of gravity.<br>
                            But there was a little girl who floated within the tunnels and danced for a bit before
                            leaving the place. She told me it was how she kept herself calm and sane when they were
                            trapped in this place.<br>
                            I memorized her dance, a comforting yet powerful routine of rhythms. If you want, I can show
                            it to you and let you have a go once I head back. The moves aren't hard. It's all about the
                            breathing and the rhythms.<br>

                            I've made plenty of new memories during this time. I still remember that you're chasing
                            after your own memories as well. I found a few places related to the old "you". Seek me out
                            if you're interested.<br>
